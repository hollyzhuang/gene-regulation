# gene-regulation

Conducted time-series computational analyses on estradiol-induced TFs gene expression in yeast cerevisiae
cell networks; expanded methodologies to Cryptococcus to identify pathways for drug target optimization
using periodicity functions, thresholding, and Local Edge Machine (LEM) for edge-finding given gene nodes
